Performance Test Report with Findings and Optimization Suggestions

Overview:
This performance test was executed using Apache JMeter to evaluate the responsiveness and stability of the LibraryApplication API. We simulated GET requests to the /api/books and /api/authors endpoints under different levels of concurrent users: 10, 50, and 100.

Findings:

1. 10 Users:
- All requests succeeded without any errors.
- The average response time for both endpoints remained low (Books: ~1ms, Authors: ~7ms).
- Throughput was around 2.2/sec for each, showing the system is responsive under low load.

2. 50 Users:
- No significant increase in error rate.
- Response times increased slightly but remained under 10ms for both endpoints.
- System handled the increase efficiently without slowdowns.

3. 100 Users:
- No errors occurred even at this load.
- Average response times stayed under 10ms.
- The system scaled well and provided consistent throughput (~4.4/sec in total).

Optimization Suggestions:

 **Compression**:
   Enable GZIP compression in responses to reduce bandwidth and speed up response transmission, especially for large datasets.

 **Caching Frequently Accessed Data**:
   Cache static data like author lists or rarely updated books to minimize repeated database hits.

 **Pagination**:
   Implement pagination or server-side filtering for endpoints that may return large datasets to prevent long responses in future data growth.

 **Asynchronous Logging**:
   If logging is enabled during API hits, ensure logs are written asynchronously to avoid blocking response flow.

 **Resource Monitoring**:
   Set up real-time resource usage monitoring (CPU, RAM, I/O) in production to preemptively detect bottlenecks before scaling is required.

Conclusion:
The API performs reliably under the tested loads. While current performance is acceptable, applying the suggestions above will ensure better scalability and readiness for higher traffic in the future.
